# Development Plans

## Fixes

- Add the doc strings with PyDoc_STRVAR and alikes

## New features

- Implement k-nearest neighbour searching, with optional distance truncation
    - Implement a priority queue with a min-heap in C, where the priority is the
      distance and the data a Point
    - Maybe add an index tracking array that maps back to the sort order of the
      inputs, which would allow returning the indices instead of the Points
