# Development Plans

## Fixes

- Implement a single method for python that can query one point or multiple
  points, switching automatically to dualtree
- Clean up the python code with concepts from the example.c file
- Add the doc strings with PyDoc_STRVAR and alikes

## New features

- Add support for angular coordinates
    - Implement new constructors that build the tree from (ra, dec) coordinates
    - Implement new query routines that take (ra, dec) points and search within
      a radius given in radians
- Implement k-nearest neighbour searching, with optional distance truncation
    - Implement a priority queue with a min-heap in C, where the priority is the
      distance and the data a Point
    - Maybe add an index tracking array that maps back to the sort order of the
      inputs, which would allow returning the indices instead of the Points
