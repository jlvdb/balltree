[ ] Implement a priority queue with a min-heap in C, where the priority is the distance and the data a Point
[ ] Implement k-nearest neighbour searching, with optional distance truncation
[ ] Implement a single method for python that can query one point or multiple points, switching automatically to dualtree
[ ] Clean up the python code with concepts from the example.c file
[ ] Implement new constructors that build the tree from (ra, dec) coordinates
[ ] Implement new query routines that take (ra, dec) points and the search radius in radians
